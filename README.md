# TAGenerator
TAGenerator is a system produced to propagate the creation, sharing and playing of textual adventure games. It provides simplified tools for creatives to design games by abstracting programming concepts behind an intuitive graphical user interface. A built in engine allows for these games to be played and shared with others.

# Features
- Create your own textual adventure game with custom rooms, items and enemies, then export and share with your peers
- Reload your game into the generator to make any updates you see fit
- Share your game files with others for collaborative efforts
- Play games other users have made through the integrated engine
- Save and load your game states so you can play for however long you want to, when you want to
